- Use NgModule's instead of standalone components.
- Use NgRx for state management.
- Use reactive forms instead of template-driven forms.
- Implement optimistic updates, persistence in local storage etc.
- Use signal-based architecture where applicable. (Note that I am in Angular 17)
- Use PrimeNG for UI components.
